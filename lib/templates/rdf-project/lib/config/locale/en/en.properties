screen.home.title = Rockdot for Dart
screen.home.headline = Welcome Aboard
screen.home.copy = With Rockdot, you write apps as well as games (or a mix of the two) in Pure Dart. No HTML, no CSS. If you happen(ed) to be a Pure Actionscript developer, you will feel at home, immediately. In fact, Rockdot was started as an ActionScript framework in 2007, and has been used in dozens of individual web apps, microsites and specials for brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Nike, Bosch, Nikon, serving millions of pageviews.
screen.home.prelude.headline01 = Rockdot Generator
screen.home.prelude.copy01 = To get you started blazingly fast, Rockdot Generator creates ready to launch project skeletons, with examples for a great number of Rockdot and StageXL features, for example its Material Design UI components implementation. Actually, you're looking at this right now.
screen.home.prelude.headline02 = How Rockdot was ported to Dart
screen.home.prelude.copy02 = So Rockdot was originally created in ActionScript and started somewhere around 2007. It has served millions of pageviews for dozens of clients in the form of high fidelity, highly interactive, specialized browser apps. As Flash Player's demise became evident, the quest for a succeeding technology was started.\n\nAnd in summer of 2014, it was found in StageXL, an implementation of Flash's diplay list for the Canvas element, written in Dart.\n\nWith Dart's syntax and StageXL's APIs being quite similar to ActionScript, the project was started by finding a way to port code over to Dart in the laziest way possible, with as much automation as possible. Abstract Syntax Tree conversion was quickly dropped in favor of good old search and replace via Regular Expressions, making it possible to manually compare the converted file with the original in case of errors (which occur). The resulting converter automates most of what's possible, more than enough to rely on the Dart Analyzer to identify any remaining conversion errors or incompatible APIs. Since then, everything has been refactored and optimized for Dart.
screen.home.prelude.headline03 = What's Rockdot's USP?
screen.home.prelude.copy03 = - Focus on highly interactive rich media applications\n- Mature UI lifecycle management\n- Asset load management\n- i18n\n- Plugin system\n- LOTS of examples\n- Generic User Generated Content backend (soon!)
screen.home.headline01 =  Best of breed. Built for speed.
screen.home.copy01 = Rockdot loads extra fast. The minified/gzipped JS comes at a mere 120 KByte, including Material Design UI components. Their underlying UI components were built years ago by some of the best ActionScript programmers in the field, resulting in snappy performance. And acceptable performance even on a seven year old iPhone 4. Rockdot generally animates at 60 fps, but has an idle mode to save on cpu load and battery whenever possible.
screen.home.headline02 = Innovation
screen.home.copy02 = Rockdot takes technology out of the way, so that teams can focus on UX and jaw dropping designs. Each generated project comes with CLI tools to collect assets and create pages and elements. And with full GAF, DragonBones, and Spine integration, you get a scalable designer-developer workflow out of the box!
screen.home.headline03 =  Total Control
screen.home.copy03 = With Rockdot, you define what happens when - control every pixel and every millisecond, and make art direction happy. Because _everything_ is built in Dart, you get full cycle introspection from logic to layout and back again. No media breach. No magic functions. No WTFs. Too much marketing speak? I'm not even done yet:
screen.home.headline04 =  Extreme Flexibility
screen.home.copy04 = Rockdot has been used for microsites, facebook apps, and mobile apps (Adobe AIR). Thanks to Spring's IoC container and smart conventions, you can plug everything together with everything else. No matter what, things won't get messy. You write Rockdot code once, and it runs anywhere.
screen.home.headline05 =  Rapid Scalability
screen.home.copy05 = A Rockdot project team usually only requires a single 'system architect', responsible for its bootstrap and creation of commands and services. All other developers can focus on the frontend and will feel at home, instantly. There have been cases where teams were scaled from one to six frontend developers without framework experience within a single day.
screen.home.headline06 =  Inherent Reusability
screen.home.copy06 = How often did you hear yourself saying: "some time after the project is done, i will clean up and reuse this and that killer feature"? Exactly, too often. Rockdot's architecture enables you to code in a sustainable fashion without losing speed.
screen.home.headline07 =  10x faster time to market than traditional html/js/css
screen.home.copy07 = No kidding. Not only will you have more certainty about what's feasible, but also way, way, way less QA.
screen.home.headline08 =  Layered Architecture
