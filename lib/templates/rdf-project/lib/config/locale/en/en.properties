screen.home.url = /
screen.home.title = Showcase
screen.home.headline = Acanvas Framework
screen.home.copy = Quickly write web apps, minigames, or anything in-between, in pure Dart. No HTML, no CSS, no JS. Acanvas Framework is part of a layered architecture (see diagram at bottom of page) originally conceived for Actionscript, and has been used in dozens of highly interactive microsites and facebook apps for brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Nike, Nikon, serving millions of pageviews.
screen.home.prelude.headline01 = Acanvas Generator
screen.home.prelude.copy01 = Acanvas Generator lets you generate Acanvas projects for Dart 2.0 and StageXL. Options are ranging from a basic Home page, to a full showcase of all available features (you're looking at this, right now).
screen.home.prelude.generator.button.label = Acanvas Generator @ Github
screen.home.prelude.generator.button.url = https://github.com/acanvas/acanvas-generator
screen.home.prelude.headline02 = Why Acanvas?
screen.home.prelude.copy02 = - Focus on highly interactive rich media applications\n- Mature UI lifecycle management\n- Asset load management\n- i18n\n- Plugin system\n- LOTS of examples\n- Generic User Generated Content backend (soon!)

screen.home.headline01 =  Best of breed. Built for speed.
screen.home.copy01 = Acanvas loads extra fast. The minified/gzipped JS comes at a mere 120 KByte, including Material Design UI components. Their underlying UI components were built years ago by some of the best ActionScript programmers in the field, resulting in snappy performance. And acceptable performance even on a seven year old iPhone 4. Acanvas generally animates at 60 fps, but has an idle mode to save on cpu load and battery whenever possible.
screen.home.headline02 = Innovation
screen.home.copy02 = Acanvas takes technology out of the way, so that teams can focus on UX and jaw dropping designs. Each generated project comes with CLI tools to collect assets and create pages and elements. And with full GAF, DragonBones, and Spine integration, you get a scalable designer-developer workflow out of the box!
screen.home.headline03 =  Total Control
screen.home.copy03 = With Acanvas, you define what happens when - control every pixel and every millisecond, and make art direction happy. Because _everything_ is built in Dart, you get full cycle introspection from logic to layout and back again. No media breach. No magic functions. No WTFs. Too much marketing speak? I'm not even done yet:
screen.home.headline04 =  Extreme Flexibility
screen.home.copy04 = Acanvas has been used for microsites, facebook apps, and mobile apps (Adobe AIR). Thanks to Spring's IoC container and smart conventions, you can plug everything together with everything else. No matter what, things won't get messy. You write Acanvas code once, and it runs anywhere.
screen.home.headline05 =  Rapid Scalability
screen.home.copy05 = A Acanvas project team usually only requires a single 'system architect', responsible for its bootstrap and creation of commands and services. All other developers can focus on the frontend and will feel at home, instantly. There have been cases where teams were scaled from one to six frontend developers without framework experience within a single day.
screen.home.headline06 =  Inherent Reusability
screen.home.copy06 = How often did you hear yourself saying: "some time after the project is done, i will clean up and reuse this and that killer feature"? Exactly, too often. Acanvas's architecture enables you to code in a sustainable fashion without losing speed.
screen.home.headline07 =  10x faster time to market than traditional html/js/css
screen.home.copy07 = No kidding. Not only will you have more certainty about what's feasible, but also way, way, way less QA.
screen.home.headline08 =  Layered Architecture
