screen.stagexl.flump.guy.headline1 = What
screen.stagexl.flump.guy.copy1 = Flump converts Flash keyframe animations into texture atlases and XML or JSON that can be easily integrated into any scene graph-based 2D game engine. Flump runtimes exist for a growing number of game engines, including Starling, Sparrow, and Flambe. Create your animations in Flash Pro / Animate CC.
screen.stagexl.flump.guy.headline2 = Why
screen.stagexl.flump.guy.copy2 = Flash CS is a powerful 2D animation tool that everyone knows how to use. But the Flash runtime's proprietary .swf format is not easily parsed, and its vector-based approach to drawing is not performant. Flump allows developers to use a Flash art pipeline without being tied to its runtime.
screen.stagexl.flump.guy.headline3 = Who
screen.stagexl.flump.guy.copy3 = Flump was created at Three Rings by Charlie Groves, Tim Conkling, and Bruno Garcia. Icon by Jon Demos and Ned Hugar.
